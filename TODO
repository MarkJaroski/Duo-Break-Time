Some things that still need to be done

* Rebuild button to avoid erronious call to Duo's purchase webservice

* Get the comment ID from a duolingo username or maybe use some cool UI to
  find a comment

* Add a wanted sites list to options to make it easier to add desired sites
  to the whitelist.
