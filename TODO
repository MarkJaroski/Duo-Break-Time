Some things that still need to be done

* Add a landing page for blocked sites

* Decrement the lingot count on purchase

* Rebuild button to avoid erronious call to Duo's purchase webservice

* Add desktop messaging to let the user know how much time is left

* Get the comment ID from a duolingo username or maybe use some cool UI to
  find a comment
